## Base Ground Fitness Studio 
This project is a full-stack Node/Express/MongoDB application that I built from scratch after learning the necessary materials within the span of 2 weeks during my Software Engineering Immersive Course at General Assembly.

The idea behind this project is to create an app for a fitness studio that allows both members and business administrators to perform different operations.

To ensure security, the app utilizes authorization and authentication, with basic authorization implemented to restrict access to features that are available only for business administrators.

The app also includes full-CRUD data operations for various features.

### CRUD Features
- User creation
- View class schedule 
- Class registration 
- Update class information 
- Delete class

## Deployment
Deployed on Cyclic.

## Future Improvements
- Remove the choice of Admin when registering for account
- Add 'My Upcoming Class' view for member
- Implement cancel class function for member
